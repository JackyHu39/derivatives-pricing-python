Simulated 1Y terminal log-return distributions under constant-vol GBM and Heston stochastic volatility. GBM produced near-Gaussian tails (kurt≈3.03) with 1% VaR of -0.449 log-return (≈ -36.1% simple return). Heston produced materially fat-tailed, negatively skewed outcomes (kurt≈8.43) with 1% VaR of -0.896 log-return (≈ -59.2% simple return), illustrating how constant-vol assumptions can substantially understate downside tail risk and motivating the observed equity volatility skew in option markets.
